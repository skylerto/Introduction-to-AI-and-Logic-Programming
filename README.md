# Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming Assignments

Here be the assignments for AI.

## Assignments

Within each of the following directories contains the solutions to the 3
assignments of the course. The assignments are as follows:

### Assignment 1

Assignment 1 contains questions on propositional logic as well as propositional
and predicate resolution.

### Assignment 2

Assignment 2 contains problems to be solved with prolog. These problems are: the
grandfather problem, merging a binary tree, and small implementation of
Robinson's resolution theorem.

### Assignment 3

Assignment 3 concerns 2 problems using AI planners. The first is a simple
planner which attempts to find and make a meal for a game character G. The
second problem is an implementation of the A start planning algorithm. A star
attempts to solve the path finding problem. I have chosen to implement A star in
Java.

## Get the Assignment

A number of utilities can be found in the bin/ folder.

the get command is a ruby script that takes the assignment number as a
commandline argument and fetched that file into a new directory with the
assignment name/number. Essentially this can also be achieved with rsync.

``` bash
rsync cse23170@red.cse.yorku.ca:/cs/course/3401/assignment1 assignment1/
```
