# AI and Logic Programming Assignments

Here be the assignments for AI.

## Get the Assignment

A number of utilities can be found in the bin/ folder.

the get command is a ruby script that takes the assignment number as a
commandline argument and fetched that file into a new directory with the
assignment name/number. Essentially this can also be achieved with rsync.

``` bash
rsync cse23170@red.cse.yorku.ca:/cs/course/3401/assignment1 assignment1/
```
