PROBLEM 1.
The following three sentences define a grandfather:

(1) X is a grandfather of Z, if X is the father of Y and Y is a parent of Z.
(2) The father of Y is a parent of Y.
(3) The mother of Y is a parent of Y.

Given the following facts:
(4) adam is the father of beth and bill.
(5) beth is the mother of chris.
(6) bill is the father of ann.

find all grandchildren of adam by doing the following:

A. Convert (1)-(6) into clauses. Use the following predicates:

   gf(X,Y) - to denote the fact that X is a grandfather of Y;
   f(X,Y) - to denote the fact that X is the father of Y;
   m(X,Y) -  to denote the fact that X is the mother of Y;
   p(X,Y) -  to denote the fact that X is a parent of Y;
   
B. Formulate an appropriate query to solve the problem (of finding all grandchildren of adam).

C. Construct a complete SLD search tree for appropriate clauses indicating the solutions.

PROBLEM 2: 

Write PROLOG programs which define the following predicates:

(a) merge(L1,L2,L) 
    to merge two sorted lists L1 and L2 producing the third sorted list L. For example,
    merge([2,5,8],[1,7,10],[1,2,5,7,8,10]) is true.

(b) delete(X,L,L1)
    to delete all occurrences of X from a list L producing the list L1. For example, 
    delete(a,[a,b,[a,d],c],L1) is true when L1 is [b,[d],c].

Test your programs on a number of examples.

PROBLEM 3. Write a PROLOG program that merges two binary search trees.
In your program, use the predicate:

   merge(T, T1, T2)  
   which is true when T2 is the result of inserting every node from T1 into T.
                               
Include some tests with your solution.

PROBLEM 4. This problem deals with the implementation of the resolution rule for Propositional Logic
in PROLOG.

Let us represent propositional logic literals as integers: positive literals are integers > 0 while
negative literals are integers < 0. A clause is just a list of literals as in these examples:
        [-1,2,3] is the clause  -1v2v3
        []       is the empty clause. 

Implement the following predicates in PROLOG:

(a) resolve(C1,C2,P,Res) 
    which returns the resolvent Res of C1 and C2 upon P, if it exists.
(b) sub(C1,C2)
    which is true if the clause C1 subsumes C2.
(c) taut(C)
    which is true if C is a tautological clause.

Include some tests with your solutions.
